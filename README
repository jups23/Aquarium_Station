This is the code for an Arduino controlling one wireless power supply via a hijacked remote. 
In addition it controls a stepper motor and a 2x20 LCD display.

Since I use it in German, every string which is printed on the LCD or via serial is in German.
The English translation could be found in the given comments.
I can guarantee for nothing - this is my first Hardware project ;-)

Clear documentation, schematic and assembly tutorial coming soon
